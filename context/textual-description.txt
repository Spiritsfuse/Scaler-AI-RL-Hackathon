🎨 Visual Description of the Activity Component
The component is a modal or sidebar section titled "Activity" and is designed to display notifications.

🖼️ Overall Structure and Layout
The component occupies a portion of the screen (likely a sidebar or modal) and has a dark purple/eggplant background color. It has a clear header, a navigation area, and a list of activity items. The text is primarily white or a lighter shade for high contrast.

📥 Header Area
The header is fixed at the top and contains the following elements:

Title: The word "Activity" in a large, bold, white font on the left.

Toggle Switch: On the right, there is a toggle switch component.

It is labeled "Unreads" in a smaller white font immediately to its left.

The switch itself is horizontal with a white or light-colored circular handle. When active (as shown), the switch's background is a contrasting color (like purple, or a bright accent color) to the handle.

🧭 Navigation/Filter Bar
Immediately below the header is a navigation bar for filtering the activity list:

"All" Tab: This tab is currently active. It is displayed in a white or light-colored font, potentially with an underline or a thicker bottom border in the same light color to indicate selection.

Other Tabs (Implied): There's an implied space for other filter tabs (e.g., "Mentions," "Threads") that would be displayed in a slightly less prominent color when inactive.

📢 Activity/Notification List
The list starts below the navigation bar and contains individual activity items.

🔔 Activity Item Structure (The "Slackbot" Example)
The visible item is from an App and has a standard notification structure:

Icon Area (Left):

Apps Label: A small text label, "Apps," appears above the icon in a less prominent, light grey font.

App Icon: A circular or squarish area containing the application's logo (Slackbot in this case). The Slackbot icon is colorful, featuring a mix of orange, pink, cyan, and black on a white background. Use an image placeholder or the lucide-react Bot icon for a generic app icon.

Content Area (Center):

Sender/Source: "Slackbot" in a bold white font.

Message: The notification text: "You're good to go! The channel #testing is now shared between your organization and New Workspace."

The message uses a light white/off-white font.

Key entities like the channel name (#testing) and the workspace name (New Workspace) are bolded for emphasis.

Action/Overflow Area (Right):

Bookmark/Save Icon: A bookmark icon (like Bookmark from lucide-react) in a white or light color. It appears to be an action to save or flag the notification.

Kebab/More Options Menu: A vertical ellipsis (three dots) icon (like MoreVertical from lucide-react) next to the bookmark, indicating a menu for more actions related to the notification.
