### 1. Active Tab ("Messages")

* **Layout:** A `flex items-center gap-2` component.
* **Icon:** `MessageSquare` (from Lucide React), `text-black`.
* **Text:** "Messages", styled as `text-black font-semibold`.
* **Active Indicator:** A thick, purple bottom border (e.g., `border-b-2 border-purple-600`). This border is positioned with padding (e.g., `pb-2`) to align perfectly under the tab.

### 2. Inactive Tab ("Add canvas")

This is the new option you want to add.

* **Layout:** A `flex items-center gap-2` component.
* **Icon:** `FileText` (or `File`) from Lucide React.
* **Text:** "Add canvas".
* **Style:** It is styled as inactive. The icon and text are grayed out (e.g., `text-gray-500`) and the font is not bold (`font-medium` or `font-normal`). It does **not** have the purple bottom border.

### 3. Add Button

* **Layout:** An icon-only button.
* **Icon:** `Plus` (from Lucide React).
* **Style:** It is also styled as inactive (e.g., `text-gray-500`).
